## MinuteTaker.io

I have enhanced MinuteTaker.io with several powerful features to make your meeting management more efficient while maintaining complete privacy and offline functionality.

## üìù Multiple Meeting Support

Now you can manage all your meetings in one place:

- Create and store multiple meetings
- Easily switch between meetings using the dropdown menu
- Each meeting keeps its own notes, action items, and settings


## ‚è±Ô∏è Meeting Timer

Keep your meetings on track:

- Start, pause, and reset a timer for each meeting
- Timer automatically saves with your meeting
- See at a glance how long your meeting has been running


## üìã Meeting Templates

Save time with reusable meeting structures:

- Create templates from your existing meetings
- Start new meetings with pre-filled information
- Perfect for recurring meetings with similar formats


## üîç Decision Tracking

Capture important decisions separately from action items:

- Record what was decided, by whom, and why
- Track decision rationale and dates
- Include decisions in your exports


## ‚ú® Enhanced Rich Text Editor

Format your minutes professionally:

- Full formatting toolbar with headings, lists, and more
- Insert tables for structured information
- Add timestamps with a single click
- Format text with bold, italic, and other styles


## How to Use These Features

1. **Managing Meetings**: Use the dropdown at the top right to switch between meetings or create new ones
2. **Using Templates**: Click the "Templates" button to save the current meeting as a template or create a new meeting from an existing template
3. **Tracking Time**: The timer appears at the top of your meeting - use the play/pause and reset buttons to control it
4. **Recording Decisions**: Switch to the "Decisions" tab to add and manage important decisions
5. **Formatting Minutes**: Use the toolbar in the "Minutes" tab to format your text professionally


All these features work completely offline and keep your data private - nothing is sent to any server unless you explicitly export your minutes.
